# hello-world

Hello all!

  I'm Bogdan, a beginner developer. I started with Python as a first programming language and
as far I can tell, it's a great language. I have somethin' like 6 months intro programming,
I know , it's still a long long road. 
 
 I will put all my projects on GitHub and I will appreciate all the support.
